This is pretty much the biggest red-alert towards legal nootropics in the US.,1238,8r7ipn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8r7ipn/this_is_pretty_much_the_biggest_redalert_towards/,454,1529058254.0,neverstopnodding,"So essentially, there’s this bill called Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act. It gives the DEA and the attorney general almost completely unchecked power to schedule any drug they see fit without following the currently established legal criteria to ban certain substances. In Section 2, Subsection 3B of the bill, this is the most worrying part that affects many different nootropics from phenibut to adrafinil or even kratom or tianepetine. 

“6)Schedule A
(A)In general
The drug or substance—

(i)has—

(I)a chemical structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(II)an actual or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(ii)is not—

(I)listed or otherwise included in any other schedule in this section or by regulation of the Attorney General; and

(II)with respect to a particular person, subject to an exemption that is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption.


(B)Predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect
For purpose of this paragraph, a predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system may be based on—

(i)the chemical structure, structure activity relationships, binding receptor assays, or other relevant scientific information about the substance;

(ii)

(I)the current or relative potential for abuse of the substance; and

(II)the clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution, or diversion from legitimate channels, of the substance; or

(iii)the capacity of the substance to cause a state of dependence, including physical or psychological dependence that is similar to or greater than that of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V. “


This is concerning due to Phenibut having a similar pharmaceutical effect to Lyrica (schedule V) nd also being able to be (A) abused, and (B) can cause addiction or dependence similar to benzodiazepines or other GABApentinoids. 

Adrafinil is an analogue of Modafinil, a schedule IV drug, so it’s obvious why that could be banned immediately. 

Here is the link to the whole bill’s information, contact your reps, we need to stop this bill.

"I just learned that 10 minutes of ""wakeful rest"" (doing nothing / no sensory input) after learning was associated with 40% higher memory retrieval a week later. What are some other cognitive-enhancing phenomena everyone should know?",1172,afwze3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/afwze3/i_just_learned_that_10_minutes_of_wakeful_rest/,100,1547509296.0,penpractice,"This is something that's important in a world with constant distraction: [Boosting Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest: Intentional Rehearsal Is Not Necessary, Consolidation Is Sufficient
](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109542). They gave two groups of people a free recall memory task. One group was then placed in a quiet room with no distractions for 10 minutes afterward, and the other group was given an additional cognitive task for 10 minutes afterward.

>Participants in the high sensory stimulation group completed 10 minutes of a spot-the-difference task, during which they were presented sequentially with 30 picture pairs on a laptop screen [2]. Their task was to identify and point to two differences between each picture pair within a 20-second time limit. Participants were instructed not to talk during the task, and care was taken to ensure that the spot-the-difference task was entirely visual: full instructions as well as a 1-minute practice trial were administered prior to Session 1 in order to minimalize verbalization during the delay. The spot-the-difference task was employed for two key reasons: firstly, it introduced new meaningful material and was cognitively demanding, thereby hampering word list consolidation [1]–[4], [6]. Secondly, it was non-verbal and highly unlike the word lists, thereby minimising potential interference at retrieval between word list memories and filler task memories [1], [2]. That is, the visual spot-the-difference task allowed us to examine the effect of sensory stimulation condition on word list consolidation specifically, without the potential confound of retrieval interference.

>Participants in the minimal sensory stimulation group were instructed to rest quietly in a darkened testing room while the experimenter went to ‘organize the next part of the study’ [2], [3]. To ensure minimal sensory stimulation, all equipment was turned off, and participants had no access to mobile phones, newspapers, etc.

What's interesting is that the additional cognitive task really wasn't that demanding, just pointing out two differences between laptops 30 times. That's not *so* dissimilar to making a comment on Reddit for 10 minutes, organizing your room for 10 minutes, etc. What this points to is the idea that you need rest not only *before* doing a cognitively-demanding task, but *immediately* afterward -- a 40% increase in material retrieval is absolutely insane. Even if commenting on Reddit is only 25% as cognitively demanding as pointing to differences in laptops, that's still a whopping 10% difference which is a full letter grade. 

I suppose to put this into practice you would need to take a 5 to 15 minute wakeful resting period after each chunk or subject that you are learning. So instead of stringing together programming / learning a language, you would pause for 10 minutes after each activity. You should also probably not text or move onto another task, unless the task is something that is similarly restful like walking.

What are some other psychological studies that people should know here?"

"Incredibly simple ADHD ""stack"". If you have ""cyclical"" ADHD symptoms, this could be the reason why.",813,a6it4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/,270,1544936383.0,synchroflashed,"**EDIT 2: Posted a** [followup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/aojy6q/a_followup_to_incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you/)

**EDIT: Hey guys, glad you all like the post, but I want to make sure you're aware of some things.These symptoms also resemble bipolar disorder. They also resemble issues with your thyroid.Arguably, thyroid issues should be checked first. And if this stuff doesn't work (some stuff might need a bit of experimentation), there's a chance you have bipolar disorder.**

Hey guys, long time lurker here. My mind is blown, and I want to share my research/self-experimentation results.

**tldr;** Folic acid, B6, B12(methylcobalamin), **but NOT in a b complex** changed everything. Magnesium, when paired with these 3, make a large difference as well. The reason why is related to metabolic pathways in processing amino acids, namely Tyrosine and Phenylalanine.

I've had what I call ""cyclical"" ADHD for a long time now. Some months, feeling really good and able to manage my symptoms effortlessly, other months completely losing control of my brain. I've been on the lookout for the explanation for my ""cyclical"" symptoms for a while now. I felt like my diet influenced how I felt, but didn't understand why. I'm pretty sure I found it. A paper called ""Genetic variants of the folate metabolic system and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may affect ADHD associated behavioral problems"" seems to have confirmed my hypothesis.

# Here were my symptoms:

1. **Severe Exhaustion**: Even when focusing on getting a lot of sleep, can’t feel “awake”.
2. **Anhedonia**: Even things that normally make me really happy or excited really have no impact on me. Life feels flat.
3. **Brain Fog/Dissociation**: Difficulty focusing. At it’s worst, life begins to feel like a dream, tunnel vision of the mind (unaware of my surroundings).
4. **Stimulants have very little/no impact, or negative**: Was prescribed Concerta to help with my ADHD symptoms, and took it again after a long break. Negative symptoms. Did not help with arousal or wakefulness, but induced anxiety and strong negative energy. Caffeine does nothing, or very little.
5. **Tremor**: Tremor associated with how I feel. Will have a strong tremor when feeling terrible.
6. **Complete lack of motivation**: Nothing feels worth it, even things that are urgent or fun. Even feeding myself is a massive struggle.
7. **Cold**: Body temperature issues seem to happen when in this state.
8. **Sleep**: Despite being exhausted all the time, falling asleep isn’t as easy as it is during a “good” cycle. Sleep feels less replenishing.
9. **ADHD**: ADHD symptoms are only really present during these cycles. Focus, attention, stability, emotional control are all non-issues during “good” cycles.
10. **Vision problems**: (sometimes, when really bad) Blurry vision, have experienced weird shapes appearing in my view.

# Explanation:

The metabolic pathways of the brain neurotransmitters are **very** complicated, and some people are just not as good at producing some required enzymes as others, but in a nutshell:

I had hypothesized that my issues were related to producing **tetrahydrobiopterin** (BH4), which is required in processing phenylalanine (which is required in the production of dopamine and serotonin). This is directly affected by the amount of methylfolate available in the body. BH4 is unstable, and methylfolate ""protects"" it. There is a syndrome called Phenylketonuria (PKU) which mirrored my symptoms pretty well, right down to the tremor. I might have a ""mild"" form of this, since I've bypassed my symptoms in the past with diet. Having issues with BH4 production will raise the levels of phenylalanine in the blood, causing other cognitive issues.

Another theory I had, was that I had an issue with **Tyrosine Hydroxylase** (TH). Interestingly, BH4 is a cofactor to TH. An issue with BH4 will lead to an issue with with Tyrosine Hydroxylase. An issue with this enzyme would explain why Methylphenidate was unable to raise the amount of dopamine in my brain (after having not taken it for weeks). TH requires vitamin B6 to produce dopamine (oversimplification). It would also explain why NALT had such a strong impact on me but lost its effectiveness. A surplus of tyrosine in the brain won't do anything if there is a TH deficiency.

B12 is also a cofactor of serotonin and dopamine, however, I don't know in what part of the chain. When it comes to metabolic pathways, methylcobalamin is superior, both in bioavailability and when it comes to methyl groups. Methylcobalamin is the active form, and doesn't require any methyl groups, allowing for more production of methylfolate. A paper I read also stated that a lack of B6 and folate will also cause a b12 deficiency. If I find it again, I'll link it here.

**So why not in b complex**? There are huge interactions between the b vitamins, and some vitamins can undo another vitamins effect. For example, Niacin absorbs methyl groups, reducing your bodies ability to create methylfolate. This can reduce the amount of BH4 available in the body, negatively impacting Tyrosine Hydroxylase! Less TH, less dopamine. Furthermore, it's hypothesized that people with ADHD contain too much Serotonin. I've read a few studies that found that an excess of serotonin can decrease dopamine transmission. From my reading, niacin (somehow) promotes Serotonin. Niacin makes me feel horrible (long after the flush)

There are many, many other details. For further reading, I recommend reading :

[(Genetic variants of the folate metabolic system and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may affect ADHD associated behavioral problems)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407547). Note that to read the whole paper, you'll probably need access to some university database.

The paper goes into much further detail, involving genetics, epigenetics, homocysteine's role in the pathophysiology of ADHD symptoms caused by metabolic issues.

Note: My background is not in biochemistry, but instead in engineering. Some stuff is also simplified into a ""nutshell"" form. There are many, many more details to this. I do not fully understand the intimate details, but loosely understand their relationship.

# Blood Tests

* A high blood level of phenylalanine indicates issues with BH4 production. Note that this likely indicates PKU, but might be mild and just aggravated by low methylfolate concentrations.
* B6 blood tests exist, but I'm not sure exactly how those work.

I wish I would have done these tests prior to taking these supplements, but since this regime works for me, why fix what's not broken?

# Stack Modifications/Additions

* **(B6)** Pyridoxal phosphate instead of Pyridoxine HCL could help some people with metabolism issues in creating the active form of vitamin B6. Be careful with excess B6, however, as it can cause neuropathy and liver damage.
* **(Folic Acid)** Methylfolate can be bought instead of folic acid, but folic acid is cheaper and effective for most people. There are some people that might benefit from this. Keep in mind that Methylfolate can have strong side effects.
* **Magnesium**: This one is well known, but lesser known is that the study commonly cited for magnesium's effectiveness with ADHD also paired magnesium with vitamin B6. The two appear to have synergistic effects?
* **BH4:** BH4 is available as a prescription medicine in the US/Canada under the brand name Kuvan. If you have a high level of phenylalanine in your blood, you likely could get a prescription for Kuvan.
* **Zinc:** This one is commonly known. Zinc is commonly low in ADHD patients. It helps me. Don't take too much.
* **SAMe:** This helps with methylation, which indirectly helps with BH4? This could help.

This is likely to only help a subgroup of ADHD patients, but it's worth looking into metabolic issues. This has really helped me.

edit: oh boy, lots to respond to. Didn't expect this to gather this much attention

Some other useful details:

1. When I'm in a good cycle, coffee affects me like crazy. I'm currently unable to finish even a small coffee without getting overstimulated. (as opposed to drinking 3 monsters back to back during a bad cycle)
2. No tremor when I feel good"
Got a threatening message from Cortex Labs - bizarre experience.,733,82q1b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/82q1b6/got_a_threatening_message_from_cortex_labs/,187,1520472602.0,KentoHa,"I rated Cortex Labs on Facebook without leaving a detailed review. Nearly instantaneous, they not only replied to this review, but also sent me a threatening private message:

""You're going to want to remove that review, before we subpoena FB to find the IP address and location of the account your using. You are not a customer of ours, and are posting negative reviews for personal reasons. You have 36 hours to remove this review.""

I then edited my review (and lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1) and added in the details of the private message they sent me. 

Their reply? 

""And that wasn't a threat. It's a promise. Our attorneys don't let people get away with fraudulent public slandering.""

Which is rather strange, considering my initial rating didn't contain a single written word, and the edit only mentioned the threatening message I received from them - so I'm not sure how that could be considered ""slanderous"" in any way.

I told my friend about this experience who then also took to the comments, and we were swiftly accused of being the same person.

Over the next hour, 5 5 star ratings mysteriously appear, raising their average rating again (some having a suspiciously similar writing style). 

Unfortunately, I have since found out [this isn't the first time Cortex Labs has acted very unprofessionally](https://imgur.com/a/qb2rf) and from these sudden 5 star ratings appearing, this also now adds some serious shadiness as well.

Needless to say, this was bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them?


/edit: It is interesting to review this post a few hours later. Ryan came here with a fake account himself, spewing insults while presenting himself as a personal ""friend"" (the same thing he actually accused others of). He has also now disabled the review section on his Facebook page completely, purging it of ALL reviews in an attempt to hide his poor behavior. 

His product (Cortex Nootropic Stack) can still be reviewed on Amazon.

I also found this [hilarious review](https://www.naturalnootropic.com/cortex-generation-1-review/) where he also felt the need to to vigorously engage with the author in the comments.

My advice to Ryan: Learn some customer relation skills, or even better: Just learn how to be a better person.

/edit 2:
It seems Ryan wasn't content just posting in this thread posing as a friend.

Now he's fighting back, and he has some choice words for users in this subreddit.

He talks about it in his [newest video](https://youtu.be/qnuJSQClxi8?t=36s), essentially calling everyone a loser (with a bad job).

He also mentions this Conor McGregor quote:

>Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

The irony of saying this while talking about other people (reddit users) seems to have been lost on him.

Unfortunately, it seems he didn't heed my advice about learning some customer relation skills or just being a better person.

All this over a wordless 2 star review that made him threaten me and claim my review was fake, because I didn't order this product from him. I guess he never realized I [could've just ordered it from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cortex-Nootropic-Stack-Performance-Monophospate/dp/B01N26XS8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), or tried some from a friend?

At this point, I really do feel a little sorry for him - in his own words, he's supposedly a vet who was (or is still) suffering from PTSD. Of course that doesn't excuse his behavior, but I hope he realizes that acting the way he does certainly won't help him OR his business succeed."

**Conclusion: Jarrow is entirely safe for consumption, as is pure nootropics.** I apologize for casting any doubt on their safety or quality.

edit: Hey everyone FYI, my post title was misleading - upon closer inspection the study focuses on ayurvedic medicines in general and not specifically ashwagandha. On top of that, it didn't study brands that are popular currently (the study is almost a decade old) and so is not by any means an accurate reflection of what you're likely to encounter while shopping online. So it's doubtful that 20% of the Ashwagandha available currently is contaminated with unsafe levels of toxic metals.

That being said, given that there is no regulatory oversight with these products, some amount of wariness and caution is always warranted to some degree.

Sorry and stay safe!"
